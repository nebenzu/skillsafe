# SkillSafe Launch Strategy

## TL;DR Recommendation
**Don't create a new X account.** Use your existing presence (@Benjamin_Kohl) for initial traction, then create @skillsafe_ after proving concept. New X accounts have near-zero reach.

## Phase 1: Soft Launch (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Deploy & Test
- Deploy to Vercel
- Buy `skillsafe.dev` (or `.app`, `.io`)
- Test with 10 real ClawHub skills
- Fix any bugs

### Day 3: Seed Communities
**Free, high-intent traffic:**
- OpenClaw Discord (you're in there) - share as "built this thing"
- r/AI_Agents post - frame as solving a real problem
- r/LocalLLM - security-conscious crowd
- r/MachineLearning - if there's a relevant thread

**Don't spam.** One thoughtful post per community, respond to comments.

### Day 4-5: Twitter Soft Launch
Tweet from @Benjamin_Kohl:
```
Built a thing: SkillSafe

7% of ClawHub skills have security flaws. 230+ malicious uploads last week.

Now you can scan before you install.

→ skillsafe.dev (free, no signup)
```

Include a screenshot of a scan result (redact anything sensitive).

## Phase 2: Product Hunt (Week 2-3)

### Prep
- Get 5 testimonials from soft launch users
- Record a 30-second Loom demo
- Create proper OG image (trust score graphic)
- Line up 5-10 people to upvote + comment on launch day

### Launch Day
- Post at 12:01 AM PT
- Share on all channels
- Respond to every comment
- Goal: Top 10 of the day

## Phase 3: Growth (Month 1+)

### Content Flywheel
1. **Weekly "Skill of Shame" tweet** - highlight a sketchy skill (be careful, don't defame real people)
2. **Monthly security report** - "ClawHub Safety Index: February 2026"
3. **Integration announcements** - browser extension, Slack bot, etc.

### Partnerships
- Reach out to OpenClaw team for potential official integration
- ClawHub might want to white-label or partner
- AI security influencers for reviews

## Should You Create @skillsafe_?

### Wait until:
- 500+ scans completed
- 50+ users asking for updates
- Ready to commit to regular posting

### Why wait:
- New accounts get throttled by X algorithm
- Building followers from scratch is slow
- Your existing account has reach already

### When you do create it:
- Use same branding (shield emoji, dark theme)
- Cross-post from @Benjamin_Kohl initially
- Focus on automated security alerts / insights

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative (Month 1)
- 1,000 free users
- 10 Pro upgrades ($9/mo) = $90 MRR

### Optimistic (Month 3)
- 10,000 free users
- 100 Pro upgrades = $900 MRR
- 5 Team plans = $145 MRR
- Total: ~$1,000 MRR

### Best Case (Month 6)
- Enterprise interest from AI companies
- ClawHub partnership/acquisition interest
- 5,000 MRR or acquisition offer
